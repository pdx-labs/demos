# Youtube Video Title and Script Generator

This demo uses the pdx library to generate a youtube video title and script based on the topic you input.

## Installation
### Install PDX

In your local Python environment, install `pdx`:

```bash
pip install pdx
``
More information about [PDX here](https://pdxlabs.io/docs/getting-started/introduction).

### Get the demo

Please feel free to clone this repository of demos to your own local environment.

## Compilation
Make sure have all the code necessary for this demo (for instance by downloading it).

To double check the files:
```bash
dir
```
The expected output should show that agent.py file is one of the existing files in the directory.

## Content Information
### `run.py` 
This is the python file that procesess the inputs made by the user and outputs the Youtube title and script generated
based on the user's inputed topic. Two agents are imported into this python file, the title generator agent and the script generator agent. The user only needs to input their desired topic into line 16 of this file using the following code:
```
_topic = 'YOUR_TOPIC'
```
The title and script of the Youtube video will be generated automatically.

### Title_Agent Folder

### `config.yaml`
This configuration file provides configuration information of the agent that generates the title of a youtube video based on the topic that the user inputs. The information contained in this file include the name of the agent, the actions made by the agent, the model of the LLM used by the agent, and the prompt templates being used. For this specific demo, gpt-3.5-turbo will be used, which is an OpenAI chat model. The title_template.jinja will be the prompt used by this agent.

### `__init__.py`
This python file creates the agent being used to generate the youtube video title with the topic input made by user. The agent folder path is also defined in this file. This is the first agent that will be used in the run.py file. It will create the input passed into the second agent that writes the script for the youtube video.

### Script_Agent Folder

### `config.yaml`
This configuration file provides configuration information about the agent that generates a youtube video script based on the title that was generated by the title_agent. The information contained in this file include the name of the agent, the actions made by the agent, the model of the LLM used by the agent, and the prompt templates being used. For this specific demo, gpt-3.5-turbo will be used, which is an OpenAI chat model. The script_template.jinja will be the prompt used by this agent.

### `__init__.py`
This python file creates the agent being used to generate the youtube video script based on the output from the title agent. The agent folder path is also defined in this file. This is the second agent that will be used in the run.py file.

### Templates

`**title_template.defaults.yaml**`
This YAML file contains the default inputs for the title prompt template. The topic input is set default to "Artificial Intelligence"

`**title_template.jinja**`
This jinja file contains the prompt template used to guide the model about creating a youtube video title based on the
topic chosen by the user.

`**script_template.defaults.yaml**`
This YAML file contains the default inputs for the script prompt template. The title input is set default to
"Understanding the Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence".

`**script_template.jinja**`
This jinja file takes in the title created by the model automatically and writes a youtube video script based on
the outputed title. Therefore, all the user needs to do is enter the main topic of the youtube video.

## Testing
`**test.yaml**`
This is a YAML test file with already set user inputs and used for testing and debugging prompt templates for demo.

## Run Demo
Before running the demo, you need to open up a terminal and set your api key, where you plan to run your script.
The following command is for Windows operating system to set up the api key in your terminal:
```
set OPENAI_KEY=<Enter your API Key without the triangular brackets>
```
NOTE: Use the command that corresponds to your operating system to set up your api key.

Once you have selected your desired topic and set your API key, use the following command to run the script:

NOTE: Make sure that you are in the same directory as the run.py file when running the command.
```
python run.py
```

Title: "Neural Networks: The Future of Artificial Intelligence"

Script:

Introduction:
Hello everyone, welcome back to our channel. Today, we're going to talk about one of the most exciting and promising fields of artificial intelligence - Neural Networks.

What are Neural Networks?
Neural Networks are a set of algorithms that are designed to recognize patterns and learn from data. They are modeled after the structure and function of the human brain, with interconnected nodes that process information and make decisions.

How do Neural Networks work?
Neural Networks work by processing large amounts of data through layers of interconnected nodes. Each node receives input from the previous layer and applies a mathematical function to it, before passing it on to the next layer. This process continues until the output layer produces a result.

Applications of Neural Networks:
Neural Networks have a wide range of applications, from image and speech recognition to natural language processing and predictive analytics. They are used in self-driving cars, virtual assistants, fraud detection systems, and many other areas.

Advantages of Neural Networks:
One of the biggest advantages of Neural Networks is their ability to learn and adapt to new data. They can improve their accuracy and performance over time, without the need for explicit programming. They are also highly parallelizable, which means they can process large amounts of data quickly and efficiently.

Challenges and Future of Neural Networks:
Despite their many advantages, Neural Networks still face some challenges, such as overfitting, bias, and interpretability. However, researchers are working on developing new techniques and algorithms to address these issues. The future of Neural Networks looks bright, with new applications and breakthroughs on the horizon.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, Neural Networks are a fascinating and powerful tool for artificial intelligence. They have the potential to revolutionize many industries and improve our lives in countless ways.
