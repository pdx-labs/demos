Islands of Hawaii

Attractions in Maui
- Molokini and Turtle Town Snorkeling Adventure aboard the Malolo 
Hawaii is renowned for the diversity of its marine life. Experience some of the island's best snorkel spots on a half-day cruise from Maui, during which you travel with ease to Molokini, a sunken volcano home to a vibrant coral reef. If conditions allow, the tour makes a bonus stop at Turtle Town or Coral Gardens to seek out a sea turtle sighting. Breakfast, lunch, and refreshments are included for a seamless experience.
Cost: from $149.95 per adult
- Hike the Haleakala crater
- Swim, snorkel and surf at the best beaches such as the Black Sand Beach  located inside Waiʻānapanapa State Park
or Ho'okipa Beach Park off the iconic Hana Highway
- Drive the Road to Hana
the road takes around 2.5 to three hours to drive because of its unique twists and turns, and the 56 single-lane bridges to tackle.
En route, pull over and trek a bit further into the rainforests on the mountainside, and there are several cascading falls to discover. To avoid getting lost and navigating tricky terrain, there are rainforest waterfall hikes to guide you.
Popular picks include hiking to Twin Falls, Upper Waikani Falls (three falls nicknamed the “three bears”), Wailua Falls and ‘The Seven Sacred Pools’ – also known as Ohe’o Gulch, and these tiered falls are inside the Haleakala National Park.
From Ohe’o Gulch, take the Pipiwai Trail which starts right here, and hike further on to Waimoku Falls. If you’re not keen on walking but still want to go waterfall hunting, there are half-day jeep tours venturing off-road through the valleys and dense forestry.
