Best Time to Go:
It's hard to beat a visit to Paris in the spring or summer when the weather is warm, 
Parisians flock to the parks, and all seems right in the world. If you want to avoid the crowds, 
a trip in the month of August — when most Parisians go on vacation — is hard to beat, although be 
prepared for some restaurant and shop closures. And somehow even during the winter, when the skies tend to 
be grey and the temperatures low, Paris still shines — all you need is an extra layer or two.

Transportation:
Trains: The easiest (and often, the fastest) way to get around the city is by train. 
There are Paris metro and RER train stops throughout the city, with a one-way journey costing around $2. 
Single and multi-day passes start at $14.
Buses: The bus network offers a great, above-ground alternative to the Paris train system. 
A single journey costs around $2 and is often used to connect metro stations that are spaced further apart.
Taxis: There are several taxi companies in Paris — G7 is a great option that accepts credit cards and has its own app. 
Uber also operates in Paris.
Car service: If you feel more comfortable arranging your airport pick-up in advance, 
take advantage of services offered by car service companies like Paris Black Cars or Blacklane.

Attractions:
1. Eiffel Tower
Address: Champ de Mars, 5 Avenue Anatole France, 75007 Paris, France
The Eiffel Tower is synonymous with Paris — in fact, we'd argue it's 
probably one of the first sights you should see in the city. From the top you'll 
get 360-degree views of the city and if you happen to visit at night, the entire 
tower illuminates with blinking lights. Magic.

2. Musee d'Orsay
Address: 1 Rue de la Légion d'Honneur, 75007 Paris, France
Paris has over 100 museums, but arguably none are more 
beautiful than the Musée d'Orsay, which is housed in an old railway 
station featuring stunning Beaux-Arts architecture. Inside, French art is 
the focus, with myriad paintings, sculptures, and photography on display —
including famous work by Claude Monet and Vincent van Gough.

3. Louvre
Address: Rue de Rivoli, 75001 Paris, France
The Louvre is known for many things — it's the world's largest art museum, 
is home to the "Mona Lisa", and was prominently featured in "The Da Vinci Code". 
But all that aside, this museum is a marvel (both visually, and in regard to the 
art it houses) — just make sure to put aside plenty of time to take it all in.

4. Notre-Dame de Paris
Address: 6 Parvis Notre-Dame - Pl. Jean-Paul II, 75004 Paris, France
For Catholics, curious tourists, lovers of French Gothic architecture, and
fan's of Victor Hugo's "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame", the cathedral is a Paris must-do. 
Since the April 2019 fire, interior access is no longer an option, but you can walk around 
the medieval cathedral on a guided tour.

5. Palais Garnier
Address: Place de l'Opéra, 75009 Paris, France
The opera may have originated in Italy, but the French 
sure know how to put on a show. At this 1,979-seat opera house, 
you can watch ballets, operas, and concerts from your perch in the historic 
building, which was built in 1875 at the request of Emperor Napoleon III. Or, 
if the opera is

6. Palace of Versailles
Address: Place d'Armes, 78000 Versailles, France
The Palace of Versailles sits just on the outskirts of Paris in the city of Versailles. 
This stunning chateau was the principal royal residence for French royalty between 1682 and 1789, 
and housed famous historical figures like King Louis XVI — the last king of France — and his iconic wife, Marie Antoinette.

7. Champs-Elysees
Address: Champs-Élysées, 8th arrondissement
This iconic avenue in the center of Paris runs from 
the Place de la Concorde to the Arc de Triomphe, which are both 
worthy sites on their own. Along what is often thought to be "the world's 
most beautiful avenue," are renowned restaurants, luxury boutiques, and renowned museums.
