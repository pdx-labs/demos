top reviews: "I think it's important to clarify a few things on this unit - for those folks that face lack of room, like me. The reality is that most people that buy such devices have small apartments and don't want to be bothered using stoves. They want easy-to-cook meals in a short amount of time. Right?

This is a TOP-HEAVY unit. It WILL topple over on an uneven surface or attempting to place it over a stove area when trying to lift open the top. It was the first thing that happened to me after I unboxed it and placed it on top of my stove. I had to lean the unit against my dutch oven (also on my stove) in order to make this whole situation work out.

When you look closely at the amazon pictures, you will notice a thick plastic on the side which extends vertically down. It is meant to make contact with the surface the unit is on.

I had previous (and cheaper) air fryers that I kept on top of my stove (due to lack of room). These were all bottom-opening units. It is why they continue to be more popular over more extravagant/larger units like the Speedi. I'll be dead-honest that these reasons are probably why the cheaper, basket-removal types of air-fryers tend to be most popular.

I have no complaints as far as how the unit itself cookes food, and I still gave it 4 stars because it does what it claims to do. It is also easy to clean, but I wait until the unit has cooled down for at least an hour.

I would've gone with a different Ninja product if I knew what I knew now.

I love the versatility of this appliance the most. I steam veggies while I airfry starches or proteins, it holds a lot and is easy to clean. To be fair it's mostly used for airfrying fries or sweet potatoes but I can't help how good air frying stuff is!

Couldn't use this product as it was 120 volts not 230 volts useless to anybody in UK.

Very disappointed this won't work in the UK due to the voltage difference between US and UK. Didn't know it was coming from the US until duties were added after check-out"
