MOSFET functions:

A metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET, MOS-FET, or MOS FET) is a
field-effect transistor (FET with an insulated gate) where the voltage determines the conductivity
of the device. It is used for amplifying or switching electronic signals. MOSFETs are now
widely used in digital and analog circuits. 

MOS represents three layers of the
M: first electrode- Gate: Consists of low-
resistivity material such as metal or
polycrystalline silicon
O: Dielectric-Silicon dioxide: stable
high-quality electrical insulator between
gate and substrate.
S: second electrode- Substrate or Body:
n- or p-type semiconductor

MOS operation can be understood by a parallel plate capacitor with metal electrodes and a
dielectric material in between.
When a voltage −𝑽 is applied between the
plates, charges −𝑸 and +𝑸 appear on the
plates. This results in an electric field
between the plates.

zero bias as shown in Figure. The energy
bands in the semiconductor are flat
indicating there is no net charges including
interface exists in the semiconductor.

With a negative gate bias with respect to the semiconductor substrate, the holes in the
semiconductor will be attracted to the interface between semiconductor and oxide, forming an
accumulative layer. This bias bends the energy band upwards and results in the valence-band
edge being closer to Fermi level at the oxide-semiconductor interface than in the bulk material,
which implies that there is an accumulation of holes.

With a positive gate bias with respect to the
semiconductor substrate, the holes in the
semiconductor will be expelled away from the
interface between semiconductor and oxide,
forming a depletion layer. This bias bends the
energy band downwards and results in the
intrinsic Fermi level being closer to Fermi level
at the oxide-semiconductor interface than in the
bulk material, which implies that there is a
space charge region formed.

With a larger positive gate bias with respect to the semiconductor substrate, the bias bends the
energy band downwards even further and results in the intrinsic Fermi level being below the
Fermi level at the oxide-semiconductor interface than in the bulk material, which implies that
there is an inversion layer of free electrons formed.

The basic MOSFET operation:
MOSFETs are four terminal devices with a Gate, Drain, Source, and Bulk as shown in
Figure. The current in a MOSFET is due to the flow of charges in the inversion layer (n-
channel) between Drain and Source.
There are 4 basic MOSFET device types. Both the p-channel and the n-channel MOSFETs are
available in two basic forms, the Enhancement mode and the Depletion mode.
Enhancement mode – the transistor requires a Gate-Source voltage, (𝑉𝐺𝑆) greater than
the threshold voltage (𝑉𝑡ℎ) level to switch the device “ON”. The enhancement mode
MOSFET is equivalent to a “Normally Open” switch.
Depletion mode – the transistor requires the Gate-Source voltage, (𝑉𝐺𝑆) to switch the
device “OFF”. The depletion mode MOSFET is equivalent to a “Normally Closed” switch.
In this class, we will focus on the n-channel enhancement MOS transistors.
