# Practice Test Question Generator

This practice test question generator uses the pdx library to generate practice test questions based 
on the topic that you choose and the content that you provide the generator in a .txt file. The demo
also generates an answer to the question as well as reasons that support the answer.

## Installation
Before installing the pdx library, ensure that you are using the latest version of python (3.11.4).
> Python Upgrade/Installation

Check the python version using the following command:
```bash
python3 --version
```
The preferable version of python is:
``` Python 3.11.4
```
Install the latest version of python from the following link if you have not done so using the
following link: https://www.python.org/downloads/

> Install pdx library and dependencies

Clone the repository containing the pdx library from the following link: https://github.com/pdx-labs/pdx

Windows: Use the following commands to clone and install the pdx library and dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pdx-labs/pdx.git
cd pdx
pip install pdx
pip install .
```
Once you have installed the library in your local environment, clone this forked repository to your
local environment. 

Windows: Use the following command to clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vxw8/Vivian_demos.git
```
After cloning the repository, add this folder "Vivian_demos" containing the demos to the pdx library folder

## Compilation
Open a new terminal and open the pdx library. Once you are in the library, go to the following folder
to run the demo:

```bash
cd Vivian_demos\demos\TestQuestionGenerator\tests
```
To check that the folder contains the script, you can run the following command
```bash
dir
```
The expected output should show that the test_1.py is in the folder

## Content Information
> config.yaml:
>> The configuration file contains information about the model to execute the prompts and the
>> templates used to create the output. For this specific demo, text-davinci-003 will be used. The template
>> that will be used to format the prompt will be test_prompt.jinja

> Templates
>> test_prompt.defaults.yaml:
This YAML file contains the default inputs for the template. The topic input is set default to Semiconductors
and the content section is information copied from a website about solar cells. The default also contains
a link to the website containing the information. This default section applies when the user does not input a topic
and content they want to base their test questions from.

>> test_prompt.jinja:
This jinja file contains the prompt template used to guide the model about the action and formating of the
output. In this case, the prompt tells the model to create 5 test questions with answers and reasoning based
on the topic and content that the user inputs.

> example_content.txt:
>>This .txt file contains an example of what the content you want to include can look like. The example
is about MOSFET devices. Note that this is just an example file that you can run if you don't have any
of your own content that you want to run.

> your_own_content.txt:
>> This is a .txt file is where you will paste in the content that you want your questions to be based
off of. You can rename this file to what you want it to be. 

> tests
>> test_1.py:
This is the script that will be run and where you can enter your own topic of interest in line 13 using the
following code:
```
topic = "<ENTER_YOUR_DESIRED_TOPIC>"
```
In line 17, this file_path should be the absolute path to the .txt file containing the content that you
want your questions to bse based off of. 
You can either choose to use the example_content.txt file or create your own by following the previous
directions about the file: your_own_content.txt.
Replace the file path with the absolute file path of your .txt file. Below is an example of what the file_path
variable could possibly look like.
```
file_path = 'YOUR_PATH\\pdx\\Vivian_demos\\demos\\TestQuestionGenerator\\example_content.txt'
```
## Run Demo
Before running the demo, you need to open up a terminal and set your api key, where you plan to run your script.
Use the following command in your terminal with your own API key:
```
set API_KEY=<Enter your API Key without the triangular brackets>
```
Once you have selected your desired topic and set your API key, you can use the following command to run the script:

NOTE: Make sure that you are in the tests folder when running the command.
```
python test_1.py
```

    "Question 1: What is a MOSFET?",
    
    "Answer 1": "A metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET, MOS-FET, or MOS FET) is a field-effect transistor (FET with an insulated gate) where the voltage determines the conductivity of the device.",
    
    "Reasons": [
        
        "It is used for amplifying or switching electronic signals.",
       
        "MOSFETs are now widely used in digital and analog circuits.",
       
        "It consists of three layers: a gate, dielectric, and substrate."

    "Answer 2": "The energy bands in the semiconductor are flat indicating there is no net charges including interface exists in the semiconductor.",

    "Question 3: What is the effect of a negative gate bias with respect to the semiconductor substrate?",
    
    "Answer 3": "The holes in the semiconductor will be attracted to the interface between semiconductor and oxide, forming an accumulative layer.",
    
    "Reasons": [
    
        "The bias bends the energy band upwards.",
        
        "This results in the valence-band edge being closer to Fermi level at the oxide-semiconductor interface than in the bulk material.",
        
        "This implies that there is an accumulation of holes."

    "Question 4: What is the effect of a positive gate bias with respect to the semiconductor substrate?",
    
    "Answer 4": "The holes in the semiconductor will be expelled away from the interface between semiconductor and oxide, forming a depletion layer.",
    
    "Reasons": [
    
        "The bias bends the energy band downwards.",
        
        "This results in the intrinsic Fermi level being closer to Fermi level at the oxide-semiconductor interface than in the bulk material.",
